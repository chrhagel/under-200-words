I read the book Factfulness. It's good. It's about how the world is better than you think. 

Part of the book is about population growth and specifically about how the center of the world will move to the Indian ocean as the population of Africa increases from one billion to four and Asia from four to five over the next 80 years or so. 

I wanted to make a tableau viz showing that shift, so I got a lot of data from <a href ="https://www.worldometers.info/population/">Worldometers</a> for all the world countries with actual population numbers from 1950 to 2020 and projections through 2050. 

2050 of course is not 80 years away. And the population in 2050 is only supposed to be 9 billion as opposed to 11 billion so the chart was a lot less impressive than I had hoped for. 

Anyway, you can <a href="INSERT LINK">download the dataset here</a>.

You too may be surprised to learn that Nigeria is on track to have more people than the USA in 2050. USA is currently number three and Nigeria is projected to take that third spot around 2050.
