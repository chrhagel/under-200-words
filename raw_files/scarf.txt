Invision’s <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/design-better/design-maturity-model/">design maturity model</a> is helpful if for nothing else it’s like staring into the void when you realize your team is as immature as all the other teams on level one. 

Then you begin introducing change. New processes. New processes that comes with demands on your designers and you get the expected pushback that you actually didn’t expect because you understand why you are making the change, and you thought you'd communicated it, and you made good arguments. And to you it's obvious. 

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGXRifu6Dmo">SCARF</a> is a great model for change management that I had learned, not used as I rolled out a process, and had to come back to because I did not use it.

The video for SCARF is less than 4 minutes. Time well spent unless you like figurative rotten tomatoes thrown at you.
