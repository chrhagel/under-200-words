A drink is at its core sugar and resistance.
 
A good drink gives you an uplift from sugar yet stops you from drinking it too fast through a certain amount of voluminous mouthfeel and often some sort of burn. 

What purpose does a drink serve? It gives you a jolt of energy and a bit of 'forget it all' mixed with being refreshing yet not something you just want to drink fast like water or milk. 

A good drink has a voluminous mouthfeel, some cold, and usually one taste note that evolves from thin to thick to some amount of after burn. Something that grows or lingers.

Why would you drink low alcoholic drinks? Probably to get less drunk, yet the drinks themselves are only real substitutes if they roughly feel the same and serve the same purpose. And for that, they need to have the right mouthfeel and the right amount of sugar kick to stimulate you the way a normal drink would.
