Ice cubes is an underappreciated way to change the taste of a drink.

Most drinks end up being one note. There is a single taste more so than beer and of course a lot more than aged spirits or wine. 

One way to change the flavor of a drink is to, for instance, hold back on the lime juice in the mix and instead add lime ice cubes in the glass and let the lime sour develop as the cubes melt while itâ€™s being drunk.

You can of course do this with other juices also.

And with simple syrups. 

If you hold back some of the sweetness in the mix you will get a spirit forward drink. 

Add ice cubes made of simple syrup to add sweetness to the drink. And preferably add another flavor also. 

You can make a cherry simple syrup and add a cherry ice cube to a bourbon drink. Or a mole simple syrup and add it to a tequila drink. Or a elderberry (get it at Ikea) ice cube to a gin drink. 

Experiment and have fun.
